# NOTE: We vendor macondo.proto in proto/vendored/macondo/ because:
# - TypeScript generation needs the proto source to generate types
# - buf generate runs in Docker and can't access ../macondo outside the context
# - We don't publish macondo to buf.build
# - The vendored proto uses go_package pointing to the ORIGINAL macondo package
#   to avoid type mismatches in Go code
